Bible verse lookup and random commandment shortcodes

Examples: 

To select a single bible verse:

    [select_bible_verse book="exodus" chapter="1" verse="9"]

    example output: "Exodus 1:9 “He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.”"

To request a random bible commandment

    [random_bible_command]

    example output: Leviticus 19:9 “”When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.”

I might add more to this in the future, but I just wanted this available for future use
